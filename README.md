Chatbot with rule-based responses: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

In this, the chatbot will:
1. Ask for your name
2. Ask for your willingness to help
3. If the negative keywords are mentiones, it will exit

In the main loop, the chatbot will:
1. Asks a random question
2. Matches intent
3. Responds
4. Allows exit at each and every step
