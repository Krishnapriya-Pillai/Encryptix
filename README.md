Internship projects

In this internship, the following projects were done:
1. Chatbot with rule-based responses: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

3. Recommendation system: Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to sers based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.
