Internship projects

In this internship, the following projects were done:
1. Chatbot with rule-based responses: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.
